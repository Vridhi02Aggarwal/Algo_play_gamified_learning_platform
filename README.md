# Algo_Play – Gamified Learning Platform for Algorithms

Algo_Play is an interactive platform built with Streamlit to learn algorithms through visualizations and quizzes.
It helps students and enthusiasts understand core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts with step-by-step animations.

 # Features

-  Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort (with visualizations).

-  Trees: Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Segment Tree (with growing tree visualization).

-  Graphs: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm (with graph visualizations).

-  Quizzes: Test your knowledge with built-in questions (quiz/quiz.json).

-  Step-by-Step Explanations: Every algorithm shows the intermediate steps with explanations.

-  Visual Learning: Algorithms are animated to make concepts easier to grasp.
